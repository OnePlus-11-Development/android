LineageOS
===========

Getting started
---------------

To get started with Android/LineageOS, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).

Initialize your local repository as you usually do for LineageOS :
```
repo init -u https://github.com/LineageOS/android.git -b lineage-20.0 --git-lfs
```
To build for the Oneplus 11, you will need specific repositories. Use these commands to sync them :
```
mkdir .repo/local_manifests && wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OnePlus-11-Development/android/master/salami.xml -O .repo/local_manifests/salami.xml
```
Then to sync up:
```
repo sync
```
Do not forget to `git lfs pull`, just in case:
```
repo forall -c 'git lfs pull'
```


Building for the Oneplus 11
------------------
To build LineageOS for the Oneplus 11, you will need to use a few commands.

Load your build environnement using this command:
```
. build/envsetup.sh
```
Use the `repopick` command to cherry-pick `kalama` related changes:
```
repopick -t 13-kalama
repopick -t 13-kalama-oplus
```
Delete device trees dependencies as they are conflicting with this setup right now:
```
rm device/oneplus/*/*.dependencies
```
You're now ready to start the build:
```
lunch lineage_salami-userdebug
m
```


Flashing the images
------------------
Our work is currently based on the CPH2449_A10 firmware. If you're not running A10, flash it and boot it at least once before flashing your build. ([CPH2449_A10 Full OTA](https://gauss-componentotacostmanual-eu.allawnofs.com/remove-0dc1e9b2e9f2d9a437851009a5949a79/component-ota/23/06/14/77b53202e03140dfa3c4728d26f9325b.zip))

Unlock your bootloader if you haven't done it before
```
fastboot flashing unlock
```
Put your phone in bootloader mode and then run:
```
fastboot -w
fastboot reboot fastboot
```
Once your device is in FastbootD mode, cd the `cd` command to navigate to your build out folder, most likely `out/target/product/salami` and run:
```
fastboot flashall
```
If you cannot flash your device using your build machine, move all images to a local machine, and use all these commands to flash the images:
```
fastboot flash boot boot.img
fastboot flash init_boot init_boot.img
fastboot flash dtbo dtbo.img
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_system vbmeta_system.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_vendor vbmeta_vendor.img
fastboot flash vendor_boot vendor_boot.img
fastboot wipe-super super_empty.img
fastboot flash odm odm.img
fastboot flash product product.img
fastboot flash system system.img
fastboot flash system_dlkm system_dlkm.img
fastboot flash system_ext system_ext.img
fastboot flash vendor vendor.img
fastboot flash vendor_dlkm vendor_dlkm.img
fastboot reboot
```
